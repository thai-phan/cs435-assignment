1. How many recursive calls are made by the non-memoized brute force version for
   computing Fib(30)? 
   Recursive: 1346268


2. How many recursive calls are made by the memoized version for computing
   Fib(30)? 
   Memoized version: 29

3. Compare the two versions (based on the resulting counts). Briefly explain why
   the brute force algorithm needs to use some form of dynamic programming?
   Recursive recalculate previous function many times that make count increase

D. LCS
